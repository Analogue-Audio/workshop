Example YARA-L Rule Structure

```
Rule 1: [Brief description of what this rule detects, linking to a TTP if possible]
events:
    [YARA-L rule code]
    [Comments explaining parts of the rule]
match:
    [Match conditions]
```

### Example 1 (YARA-L for Registry Modification):

The report shows that the malware runs the following command:
`Detects when an attacker tries to disable User Account Control (UAC) by setting the registry value 'EnableLUA' to 0`

The YARA-L rule will be as such:

```
Rule: Detect UAC Bypass via EnableLUA Registry Modification (T1548.002 # Bypass User Account Control)
events:
  // Target Windows Sysmon Registry Modification events
  $e.metadata.base_labels.log_types = "WINDOWS_SYSMON"
  $e.metadata.event_type = "REGISTRY_MODIFICATION"
  $e.metadata.product_event_type = "13" // Sysmon Event ID 13 for RegistryValueChange

  // Ensure the target registry key is 'EnableLUA' under System Policies
  $e.target.registry.registry_key = "HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\EnableLUA"
  // Detect setting the value to 0, which disables UAC
  $e.target.registry.registry_value_data = "DWORD (0x00000000)"

  // Optional: Capture hostname and process for context
  $e.principal.hostname = $hostname
  $e.principal.process.file.full_path = $process_path
  $e.principal.process.command_line = $process_cmd

match:
  $e
```

### Example 2 (YARA-L for Outbound Connection):

The report states that:
```The malware uses a non-browser process interacting with the Telegram API which might indicate the use of a covert C2.```

The YARA-L rule could be as such:

```
Rule: Detect Non-Browser Process Interacting with Telegram API for Covert C2 (T1071.001 # Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols / T1102.002 # Web Service: Social Media)
events:
  // Match Sysmon DNS events
  $e.metadata.event_type = "NETWORK_DNS"
  $e.metadata.log_type = "WINDOWS_SYSMON"
  $e.metadata.product_event_type = "22" // Sysmon Event ID 22 for DnsQuery

  // Exclude common browser processes that might legitimately interact with Telegram (e.g., web.telegram.org)
  $e.principal.hostname = $host
  $e.principal.process.command_line = $process
  $process != /chrome.exe|firefox.exe|iexplore.exe|MicrosoftEdge.exe|msedge.exe|opera.exe|safari.exe|seamonkey.exe|vivaldi.exe|whale.exe/
  // Specifically look for DNS queries to the Telegram API domain
  $e.network.dns.questions.name = "api.telegram.org"

  // Capture hostname and process for context
  $e.principal.hostname = $host
  $e.principal.process.command_line = $process_cmd

match:
  // Trigger on the first occurrence of this activity within a short timeframe
  // Consider adjusting the timeframe (e.g., 5m, 1h) based on expected activity patterns
  $e over 5m
```
